## What is Computer Vision?

# 

**Computer Vision (CV)** helps computers **see and understand images and videos**, like humans.

📌 **Simple definition:**  
Computer Vision enables machines to extract information from images.

* * *

## Computer Vision Pipeline (Easy)

# 

1.  Image preprocessing
    
2.  Feature extraction
    
3.  Model training
    
4.  Prediction
    

* * *

## 1\. Image Preprocessing

### Why needed?

# 

Raw images are:

*   Large
    
*   Noisy
    
*   Inconsistent
    

Preprocessing makes images **model-ready**.

* * *

### Common Image Preprocessing Steps

# 

*   Resizing images
    
*   Normalization (pixel values 0–1)
    
*   Grayscale conversion
    
*   Noise removal
    
*   Data augmentation (flip, rotate)
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Image preprocessing prepares raw images for CV models.

* * *

## 2\. Image Classification

### What is Image Classification?

# 

*   Assigns a **label** to an image
    

### Example

# 

*   Cat / Dog
    
*   Car / Bike
    

* * *

### Used Models

# 

*   CNN
    
*   ResNet
    
*   VGG
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Image classification predicts the class of an image.

* * *

## 3\. Object Detection

### What is Object Detection?

# 

*   Detects **what object**
    
*   Detects **where it is** (bounding box)
    

* * *

### Example

# 

*   Detect people in a photo
    
*   Detect cars on road
    

* * *

### Popular Algorithms

# 

*   YOLO
    
*   SSD
    
*   Faster R-CNN
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Object detection identifies objects and their locations.

* * *

## 4\. Face Recognition

### What is Face Recognition?

# 

*   Identify or verify a person using face
    

* * *

### Steps

# 

1.  Face detection
    
2.  Feature extraction
    
3.  Face matching
    

* * *

### Applications

# 

*   Mobile unlock
    
*   Attendance systems
    
*   Security systems
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Face recognition identifies people using facial features.

* * *

## 5\. CNNs for Images

### Why CNNs are used?

# 

CNNs are good at:

*   Capturing spatial features
    
*   Handling image data efficiently
    

* * *

### Key CNN Components (Quick)

# 

| Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Convolution | Feature extraction |
| Pooling | Reduce size |
| Fully Connected | Prediction |

* * *

### Advantages of CNNs

# 

*   Fewer parameters
    
*   High accuracy
    
*   Automatic feature learning
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
CNNs are best suited for image-related tasks.

* * *

## CV vs NLP (Quick)

# 

| Computer Vision | NLP |
| --- | --- |
| Image data | Text data |
| CNN | RNN / Transformers |
| Pixels | Words |

* * *

## Real-World CV Applications

# 

*   Self-driving cars
    
*   Medical imaging
    
*   Surveillance
    
*   OCR
    
*   Face unlock
