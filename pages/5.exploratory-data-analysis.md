# 

* * *

## What is EDA?

# 

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of **understanding the data before building a model**.

EDA helps you:

*   Know what the data contains
    
*   Find patterns
    
*   Detect errors
    
*   Make decisions for preprocessing
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
EDA is used to analyze and understand the main characteristics of a dataset.

* * *

## 1\. Understanding Datasets

# 

Before anything, **look at the data**.

### Common Questions

# 

*   How many rows and columns?
    
*   What are the column names?
    
*   What data types are present?
    
*   Are there missing values?
    

### Useful Pandas Functions

# 

df.head()

df.tail()

df.shape

df.columns

df.info()

📌 This step avoids mistakes later.

* * *

## 2\. Descriptive Statistics

# 

Descriptive statistics **summarize the data**.

### Key Measures

# 

*   Count
    
*   Mean
    
*   Median
    
*   Standard deviation
    
*   Min & Max
    

### Pandas Command

# 

df.describe()

### Why needed?

# 

*   Understand data distribution
    
*   Detect outliers
    
*   Compare features
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the dataset.

* * *

## 3\. Data Visualization

# 

Visualization helps **see patterns clearly**.

### Common Charts

#### 1\. Histogram

# 

*   Shows data distribution
    
*   Useful for checking normal distribution
    

#### 2\. Box Plot

# 

*   Detects outliers
    
*   Shows spread of data
    

#### 3\. Bar Chart

# 

*   Categorical data comparison
    

#### 4\. Scatter Plot

# 

*   Relationship between two variables
    

### Example

# 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(df\["age"\])

plt.show()

📌 A picture explains data better than numbers.

* * *

## 4\. Finding Patterns & Relationships

# 

We want to know:

*   How features are related
    
*   Which feature affects output
    

### Methods

# 

*   Scatter plots
    
*   Correlation matrix
    
*   Pair plots
    

### Correlation

# 

*   Positive: move together
    
*   Negative: move opposite
    
*   Zero: no relationship
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Correlation helps identify relationships between variables.

* * *

## 5\. Detecting Anomalies (Outliers)

### What are anomalies?

# 

Data points that are **very different** from others.

### Example

# 

*   Normal age: 20–60
    
*   Anomaly: 150
    

### Methods to detect

# 

*   Box plot
    
*   Z-score
    
*   IQR method
    

### Why important?

# 

*   Can mislead the model
    
*   Can reduce accuracy
    

📌 Always check if anomalies are errors or real values.

* * *

## EDA Workflow (Easy to Remember)

# 

1.  Load data
    
2.  Understand structure
    
3.  Check missing values
    
4.  Use statistics
    
5.  Visualize data
    
6.  Find relationships
    
7.  Detect anomalies
