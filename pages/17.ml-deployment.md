## What is ML Deployment?

# 

**ML Deployment** means **using a trained model in real applications** so users can get predictions.

📌 **Simple definition:**  
Deployment makes an ML model usable in real life.

* * *

## ML Deployment Flow (Easy)

# 

1.  Train model
    
2.  Save model
    
3.  Create API
    
4.  Deploy to server
    
5.  Monitor model
    

* * *

## 1\. Model Serialization

### What is Model Serialization?

# 

*   Saving trained model to a file
    
*   Load later without retraining
    

* * *

### Why needed?

# 

*   Saves time
    
*   Reuse model
    
*   Production usage
    

* * *

### Popular Methods

#### Pickle

# 

*   Python built-in
    
*   Easy to use
    

📌 Best for small models

* * *

#### Joblib

# 

*   Faster than pickle
    
*   Better for large models
    

📌 Used widely in ML

* * *

📌 **Interview line:**  
Model serialization saves trained models for reuse.

* * *

## 2\. Building APIs

### Why APIs?

# 

*   To connect model with frontend / mobile / other services
    

* * *

### Flask

# 

*   Lightweight
    
*   Easy to learn
    
*   Good for simple projects
    

📌 Good for beginners

* * *

### FastAPI

# 

*   Very fast
    
*   Auto documentation
    
*   Modern framework
    

📌 Best for production

* * *

📌 **Interview line:**  
APIs expose ML models for real-world usage.

* * *

## 3\. Model Monitoring

### What is Model Monitoring?

# 

*   Tracking model performance after deployment
    

* * *

### Why important?

# 

*   Data changes
    
*   Accuracy drops
    
*   Model becomes outdated
    

* * *

### What to Monitor?

# 

*   Prediction accuracy
    
*   Data drift
    
*   Latency
    
*   Errors
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Monitoring ensures deployed models perform well over time.

* * *

## 4\. Handling Real-Time Data

### What is Real-Time Data?

# 

*   Data arrives continuously
    
*   Example: stock price, sensor data
    

* * *

### Challenges

# 

*   Low latency
    
*   Fast predictions
    
*   High availability
    

* * *

### Solutions

# 

*   Streaming (Kafka)
    
*   REST APIs
    
*   Batch + real-time hybrid
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Real-time ML systems handle continuous incoming data.

* * *

## Flask vs FastAPI (Interview Table)

# 

| Feature | Flask | FastAPI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed | Moderate | Very fast |
| Documentation | Manual | Automatic |
| Async support | Limited | Full |
| Best for | Simple apps | Production |

* * *

## Real-World Deployment Examples

# 

*   Recommendation system
    
*   Spam detection API
    
*   Face recognition app
    
*   Chatbots
    

* * *

## Interview Quick Notes 🧠

# 

✅ Deployment = model in production  
✅ Pickle & Joblib save models  
✅ APIs connect model to users  
✅ FastAPI is production-ready  
✅ Monitoring avoids performance drop  
✅ Real-time data needs fast prediction
