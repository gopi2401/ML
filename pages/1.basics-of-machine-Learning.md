## What is Machine Learning?

##

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a method where a computer **learns from data** and **makes decisions or predictions** without being explicitly programmed.

👉 Instead of writing rules, we **give data** and the machine **finds patterns**.

### Simple Example

##

- You show 1000 spam emails and 1000 normal emails
- The machine learns patterns
- Next time, it automatically detects spam

📌 **Definition (Interview-ready):**  
Machine Learning is a technique that enables computers to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

## Why Machine Learning is Needed?

##

Traditional programming:

Rules + Data → Output

Machine Learning:

Data + Output → Rules

### Reasons ML is needed:

##

- Huge amount of data
- Too many rules to write manually
- Better accuracy over time
- Automation of decision making

### Real-life problems:

##

- Fraud detection
- Recommendation systems
- Voice recognition

## Types of Machine Learning

##

There are **4 main types** of Machine Learning:

1.  Supervised Learning
2.  Unsupervised Learning
3.  Semi-Supervised Learning
4.  Reinforcement Learning

---

## 1\. Supervised Learning

### What is it?

##

Learning using **labeled data**.

👉 Data has **input + correct output**.

### Example

##

| Input      | Output          |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Email text | Spam / Not Spam |
| House size | Price           |

### Common Algorithms

##

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM

### Used for:

##

- Classification
- Regression

📌 **Interview line:**  
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train a model to predict correct outputs.

---

## 2\. Unsupervised Learning

### What is it?

##

Learning from **unlabeled data**.

👉 No correct answer is given.

### Example

##

- Grouping customers by behavior
- Finding patterns in data

### Common Algorithms

##

- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- PCA

### Used for:

##

- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction

📌 **Interview line:**  
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

---

## 3\. Semi-Supervised Learning

### What is it?

##

Combination of **small labeled data + large unlabeled data**.

### Example

##

- 100 labeled images
- 10,000 unlabeled images

Used when labeling data is expensive.

### Applications

##

- Image recognition
- Speech recognition

📌 **Interview line:**  
Semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training.

---

## 4\. Reinforcement Learning

### What is it?

##

Learning by **trial and error** using **rewards and penalties**.

### Key Components

##

- Agent (Learner)
- Environment
- Action
- Reward

### Example

##

- Chess
- Games
- Robot navigation

📌 **Interview line:**  
Reinforcement learning trains an agent to take actions that maximize rewards.

## ML vs AI vs Deep Learning

##

| Feature    | AI             | ML                 | Deep Learning                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Definition | Smart machines | Learning from data | Learning using neural networks |
| Dependency | —              | Part of AI         | Part of ML                     |
| Data       | Low / High     | High               | Very High                      |
| Example    | Chatbot        | Spam filter        | Face recognition               |

📌 **Simple line:**  
AI is the big concept, ML is a subset of AI, and Deep Learning is a subset of ML.
