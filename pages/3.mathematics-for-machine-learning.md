## Why Math is Needed in ML?

# 

Math helps ML models:

*   Understand data
    
*   Find patterns
    
*   Make predictions
    
*   Optimize results
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Math provides the foundation for understanding how ML algorithms work.

* * *

# A. Linear Algebra

# 

Linear Algebra is mainly about **numbers in rows and columns**.

* * *

## 1\. Scalars, Vectors, Matrices

### Scalar

# 

A **single number**.

Example:

5, -3, 0.7

Used for:

*   Learning rate
    
*   Weights
    

* * *

### Vector

# 

A **list of numbers**.

Example:

\[2, 4, 6\]

In ML:

*   One data point
    
*   Feature values
    

* * *

### Matrix

# 

A **table of numbers** (rows × columns).

Example:

\[1  2  3\]

\[4  5  6\]

In ML:

*   Dataset
    
*   Images
    
*   Weights
    

📌 **Interview tip:**  
Dataset is usually stored as a matrix.

* * *

## 2\. Matrix Operations

### Addition

# 

Add same-position elements.

### Subtraction

# 

Subtract same-position elements.

### Multiplication

# 

Very important in ML.

Example:

Data Matrix × Weight Matrix = Output

📌 Used in:

*   Linear Regression
    
*   Neural Networks
    

* * *

## 3\. Dot Product

# 

Dot product = **multiply + add**

Example:

\[1, 2\] · \[3, 4\]

\= (1×3) + (2×4)

\= 11

In ML:

*   Used to calculate predictions
    
*   Used in similarity checks
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Dot product measures similarity between vectors.

* * *

## 4\. Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors (Simple Idea)

### Simple meaning:

# 

They show **important directions** in data.

*   Eigenvector → direction
    
*   Eigenvalue → importance
    

Used in:

*   PCA (dimensionality reduction)
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Eigenvectors define directions of maximum variance in data.

* * *

# B. Probability

# 

Probability measures **how likely something is to happen**.

* * *

## 1\. Probability Basics

# 

Formula:

Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes

Example:

*   Toss a coin
    
*   P(Head) = 1/2
    

In ML:

*   Classification
    
*   Predictions
    
*   Uncertainty handling
    

* * *

## 2\. Conditional Probability

# 

Probability of event A **given** event B happened.

Formula:

P(A | B)

Example:

*   Probability of rain **given** cloudy sky
    

📌 Used in:

*   Spam detection
    
*   Medical diagnosis
    

* * *

## 3\. Bayes Theorem

# 

Used to **update probability** using new information.

Formula:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Simple meaning:

> New belief = Old belief + New evidence

Used in:

*   Naive Bayes algorithm
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Bayes theorem updates probability based on new data.

* * *

## 4\. Random Variables

# 

A variable whose value is **random**.

Types:

*   Discrete (0 or 1)
    
*   Continuous (any value)
    

Example:

*   Dice number
    
*   Temperature
    

Used in:

*   Probability models
    
*   Predictions
    

* * *

# C. Statistics

# 

Statistics helps **summarize and understand data**.

* * *

## 1\. Mean, Median, Mode

### Mean (Average)

# 

Sum / Count

### Median

# 

Middle value

### Mode

# 

Most frequent value

📌 Used to:

*   Understand data distribution
    

* * *

## 2\. Variance & Standard Deviation

### Variance

# 

How spread out data is.

### Standard Deviation

# 

Square root of variance.

Example:

*   Low SD → data close together
    
*   High SD → data spread out
    

📌 Used in:

*   Feature scaling
    
*   Risk analysis
    

* * *

## 3\. Normal Distribution

# 

Also called **bell curve**.

Features:

*   Symmetric
    
*   Mean = Median = Mode
    

Example:

*   Height of people
    
*   Exam scores
    

📌 Used in:

*   Probability models
    
*   Assumptions in ML algorithms
    

* * *

## 4\. Correlation vs Covariance

### Covariance

# 

Shows direction of relationship.

*   Positive → move together
    
*   Negative → move opposite
    

### Correlation

# 

Standardized covariance.

*   Range: -1 to +1
    
*   Easy to understand
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Correlation measures strength and direction of relationship between variables.
