## What is NLP?

# 

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of AI that helps computers **understand, read, and process human language**.

📌 **Simple definition:**  
NLP allows machines to understand text and speech like humans.

* * *

## NLP Pipeline (Easy Flow)

# 

1.  Text preprocessing
    
2.  Feature extraction
    
3.  Model training
    
4.  Prediction
    

* * *

## 1\. Text Preprocessing

### Why preprocessing?

# 

Raw text is **dirty** and **unstructured**.

Preprocessing makes text **clean and usable**.

* * *

### Common Preprocessing Steps

# 

*   Lowercasing
    
*   Removing punctuation
    
*   Removing numbers
    
*   Removing extra spaces
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Text preprocessing cleans raw text for NLP models.

* * *

## 2\. Tokenization

### What is Tokenization?

# 

*   Splitting text into smaller units
    
*   Words or sentences
    

### Example

# 

"I love ML" → \["I", "love", "ML"\]

📌 **Interview line:**  
Tokenization breaks text into words or tokens.

* * *

## 3\. Stopwords

### What are Stopwords?

# 

*   Common words with little meaning
    
*   Example: _is, the, am, are_
    

### Why remove them?

# 

*   Reduce noise
    
*   Improve model performance
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Stopwords are commonly removed to improve NLP results.

* * *

## 4\. TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)

### What is TF-IDF?

# 

*   Converts text to numbers
    
*   Measures word importance
    

* * *

### Simple Idea

# 

*   TF → How often word appears
    
*   IDF → How rare the word is
    

📌 **High TF-IDF = Important word**

📌 **Interview line:**  
TF-IDF gives importance to words based on frequency and rarity.

* * *

## 5\. Word Embeddings

### What are Word Embeddings?

# 

*   Dense numeric representation of words
    
*   Captures meaning and similarity
    

* * *

### Examples

# 

*   Word2Vec
    
*   GloVe
    
*   FastText
    

📌 **King − Man + Woman = Queen**

📌 **Interview line:**  
Word embeddings represent words in vector space with meaning.

* * *

## 6\. Sentiment Analysis

### What is Sentiment Analysis?

# 

*   Identifies emotion in text
    
*   Positive, Negative, Neutral
    

* * *

### Example

# 

"I love this product" → Positive

"I hate this service" → Negative

* * *

### Used In

# 

*   Product reviews
    
*   Social media analysis
    
*   Customer feedback
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Sentiment analysis detects emotion in text data.

* * *

## 7\. Text Classification

### What is Text Classification?

# 

*   Assign labels to text
    
*   Spam detection
    
*   News categorization
    

* * *

### Examples

# 

*   Email: Spam / Not Spam
    
*   News: Sports / Politics / Tech
    

📌 **Interview line:**  
Text classification assigns predefined labels to text.

* * *
